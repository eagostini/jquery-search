### Introduction

It's a very simple unified implementation of `find` and `addBack` in the same method. Trust me, it's annoying having to write them all the time...

```html
<form name="note">
    <label>
        <span>Title:</span>
        <input name="title" type="text" />
    </label>
</form>
```

```javascript
$('form').search('[name]');
```

If it's either not enough or you found any bug in this plug-in, please, let me know creating an issue [here](https://github.com/eagostini/jquery-search/issues). I appreciate your help!
